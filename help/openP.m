%% Opening segmentation projects with PhyloCell
%
%% Loading a project
%
% Open phyloCell main GUI;
%
%   phyloCell_mainGUI;
%
% Go to File > Open timeLapse project...
%
% Select the .mat file that corresponds to your project.
%
%%
% 
% <<open.png>>
% 
% Then, select the position and segmentation file that you wish to work
% with. A project may contain an infinite number of positions. To each
% position is associated one or more segmentation files, which contains the result of the segmentation processes. 
% It is often convenient to duplicate or backup segmentation files.
% Therefore, the opening functions allows the user to select the
% appropriate segmentation file upon loading.
%

%% Switch to another position (once a project is open)
%
% Once a timeLapse project has been loaded, you can switch to a different
% position by clicking File > Switch to another position...
% This will prompt to enter a new position and a segmentation file, see
% above.
